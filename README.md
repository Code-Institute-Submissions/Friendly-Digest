# **Friendly Digest** <a name="top"></a>

Friendly Digest is a website designed to provide food recipes, primarily for people with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's Disease & Colitis.
Users are able to follow the four basic CRUD functions, Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This means that you can register an account, create and upload your
own recipes, view other user's recipes, edit your own recipes, and delete your own recipes.

Friendly Digest is intended to provide great value to those who seek special diatary advice. Whether you suffer yourself, have a friend or family member who 
suffers, or whether you want to clean up your own diet, we hope Friendly Digest can guide you to a cleaner, happier, pain-free lifestyle.

The idea for Friendly Digest originates very close to home. An extremely close family member unfortunately suffers from Crohn's disease, therefore we have spent
many years struggling to find decent recipes which are suitable for those who have a variety of different requirements. Although it has been a long journey, we 
are now able to live a healthier, somewhat pain-free lifestyle due to what we put in our bodies. We hope that we can share some of this knowledge with you.

Feel free to browse through Friendly Digest's extensive library of recipes, we hope that you manage to find something yummy to satisfy your needs! Create an 
account and upload your own yummy dishes to share with others, but remember, keep it clean!
