            <p>Friendly Digest was originally designed to help people with chronic
                inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's Disease & Colitis. Having any
                kind of inflammatory bowel disease can severely limit your dietary options
                and thus implicate health issues in later life. Friendly Digest is an
                aid to anyone who struggles to consume the correct foods, it offers an
                extensive array of recipes, each containing ingredients which are kind to
                the digestive system. Whether you suffer yourself, have a friend or family member
                who suffers, or whether you want to clean up your diet, we hope Friendly
                Digest can guide you to a cleaner, happier, pain-free lifestyle.

            <p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes
                a group of conditions, the two main forms of
                which are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
                Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases
                that inflame the lining of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract
                and disrupt your body's ability to digest food,
                absorb nutrition, and eliminate waste in a healthy manner.
                These are lifelong diseases and people can experience
                acute periods of active symptoms (active disease or flare),
                and other times when their symptoms are absent (remission).</p>

<!--Informational Text about Bacteria-->

        <div class="col s12 mt-3">
            <p>Think bacteria are bad? Think again! Bacteria and other microbes (including fungi
                and viruses) are often thought of as sources of disease, but in fact many play an essential
                role in keeping you healthy. Your body contains trillions of microbes, most of which are
                beneficial. The most dense microbe population is in your gut, where they play a critical role
                in digestion, immune function and weight regulation. What you eat can quickly change
                your microbes, but are you eating the right foods to help your good gut bacteria?</p>
